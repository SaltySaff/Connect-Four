This project will involve the creation of the game Connect Four, using Ruby, and more specifically: RSpec.
While creating Connect Four using Ruby will provide invaluable experience, the main aim of this project is to
to use test-driven developement in the coding process, creating tests using RSpec, and then making these tests
pass. While I have read about the many benefits TDD can bring to the coding process, I hope to experience this 
for myself in this project.
