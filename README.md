# Connect Four with RSpec
Welcome to the Connect Four with RSpec project! The goal of this project is to create a version of the classic game Connect Four using the Ruby programming language and to apply test-driven development (TDD) in the coding process.

By using TDD, we aim to write tests for the different components of the game before implementing the actual code, and then iteratively make these tests pass. This approach is known to bring numerous benefits to the development process, including improved code quality, reduced bugs, and increased confidence in the code.

This project will be a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience with TDD and to better understand its benefits. We will use the RSpec testing framework to write the tests, which is a popular tool for testing Ruby code.
